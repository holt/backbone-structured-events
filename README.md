# backbone-structured-events #

By default, the [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) Event module stores the callbacks bound to an object as a flat list of keypair values. Using a set of dot-notation delimited event names as an example, the event catalog looks something like this:

![Default Backbone Event Structure](https://raw.github.com/holt/backbone-structured-events/master/img/events-before.png)

The Backbone Structured Events (BSE) module organizes delimited-name events such as these into an object hierarchy, and instead produces this:

![Rejigged Backbone Event Structure](https://raw.github.com/holt/backbone-structured-events/master/img/events-after.png)

Because the event stack is now an ordered object hierarchy, group operations are easier to implement; for example, binding, unbinding, or adding wrappers around common groups of events. To illustrate this, the BSE library provides a few additional methods that allow us to take advantage of this new object model.

## Installation ##

BSE can run either as a standalone event broker (all methods are added to a global `__Events__` object) or as a regression tested replacement for Backbone's internal `Backbone.Events` module (if detected - ensure that BSE is loaded *after* Backbone). The only hard dependency is [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) which must be included in your page/app.

## Examples ##

All existing [Backbone Event API](http://backbonejs.org/#Events) module methods will work as expected when using BSE. The following sections describe additional methods.

#### .deepTrigger() ####

Create an object with a `Backbone.Events` mixin:

```javascript
var obj = _.extend({}, Backbone.Events);
```    
Create some callbacks:

```javascript
var first = function () {
   console.log('First:  pre-initialization event...');
   return this;
}, second = function () {
   console.log('Second: pre-initialization event...');
   return this;
}, show = function () {
   console.log('Show:   dialog is displayed...');
   return this;
}, last = function () {
   console.log('Last:  the dialog does something else...');
   return this;
};
```

Bind some events - this can happen in no particular order as the object structure is created or extended deterministically:

```javascript
obj.on('app.dialog.pre.first', first);
obj.on('app.dialog.pre.second', second);
obj.on('app.dialog.show.last', last);
obj.on('app.dialog.show', show);
```

Use `.deepTrigger()` to fire events that are on an object, under an object, or both. Some examples:

```javascript
obj.deepTrigger('app.dialog');        // first, second, show, last
obj.deepTrigger('app.dialog.pre');    // first, second
obj.deepTrigger('app.dialog.show');   // show, last
obj.deepTrigger('app.dialog.show.*'); // last
```
Standard `.trigger()` still works as expected by firing all events on an object, but *without* firing any child events:

```javascript
obj.trigger('app.dialog.show'); // show
```
#### .destroy() ####

Unbind all *child* events on an object:

```javascript
obj.destroy('app.dialog.show.*'); 
```    
Unbind *all* events, including child events, on object:

```javascript    
obj.destroy('app.dialog.show'); 
```

Standard `.off()` still works as expected by unbinding all events on an object, but *without* unbinding any child events:

```javascript
obj.off('app.dialog.show'); 
```

#### .setSeperator() ####
    
The default seperator is a period `.` but you can change it to something else: 

```javascript
obj.setSeperator('-');
```
